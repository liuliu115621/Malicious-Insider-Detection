# Malicious-Insider-Detection

Information Communications Technology (ICT) systems are facing an increasing number of cyber security threats, the majority of which are originated by insiders. However, most of existing security technologies aim to defend against cyber outsider attacks. 

In this work,we reviewed the existing work and demonstrated our current work to help increasing detection performance, which reduced the dependency of security experts and security analysts. There are two papers have been published. 

1. Detecting and Preventing Cyber Insider Threats: A Survey

2. Anomaly-based Insider Threat Detection using Deep Autoencoders
